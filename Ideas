- should |if| handle nothing as false? (Any kind of nothing.)
  hmm. wow. There we have various kinds of nothing then. Wonderful.


- refcounting: free should check whether object has a refcount?  or
  well, if it is 1, then free it directly as normal.  Otherwise,
  decrement. Thus mutation only happens on non-normal-free
  case. fine?!

  Although, increments--but where do those happen ?

  -- build refcounting on top of S3C?  [should build closures on top,
     as well?]


- destructive updates (inplace instead of copying) automatic? no,
  would be a layer on top? or, if free flag is true then we're free to
  reuse, so, hand coded in places where that's possible?  (But: what
  about use-after-free issues: bad, testing wouldn't reveal those
  correctly (or use a 'generation counter' (part of refcount?)
  field?). Thus: ?)
