Safe C
Secure C
S-expression based C

Safe mode: 

running with checks through a GC, with safe type checking, bounds
checking.

Secure:

optionally 'enrich' values with precise or complex types, run
safety-checks through asserts / type checks, and (randomized, property
based) tests.

S-expression based:

with Scheme macros on top.
